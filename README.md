# bizCase-03-aerofit-customer-profiling

## Business Problem:
Aerofit is a leading brand in the field of fitness equipment. The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better recommendation of the treadmills to the new customers. The team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product with respect to customer characteristics.

Product Portfolio:
- The KP281 is an entry-level treadmill that sells for $1,500.
- The KP481 is for mid-level runners that sell for $1,750.
- The KP781 treadmill is having advanced features that sell for $2,500.

## bizCase Highlights:
- We have performed descriptive statistics on the dataset.
    - Studied the distribution of various (numerical) features and commented on the central tendencies of the same.
    - Identified the outliers and have performed outlier treatment.
    - Converted a few numerical features into categorical features to create groups which help us to understand the customer profile in depth.
- We have used conditional probability to understand the customer profile (gender, marital-status, age, income, fitness etc) across the different treadmill products.
- Using EDA, we have summarized the important business insights and have also come up with some business recommendations which are backed by data.
